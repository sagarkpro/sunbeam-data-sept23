# ASP.NET Core
- ASP.NET Core is the modern, high-performance web development framework for .NET, that runs on Windows, Linux, macOS, and Docker.
- ASP.NET is a popular web-development framework for building web apps on the .NET platform.
- ASP.NET Core is the open-source version of ASP.NET, that runs on macOS, Linux, and Windows. 
- ASP.NET Core was first released in 2016 and is a re-design of earlier Windows-only versions of ASP.NET.

## Advantages of ASP.NET Core

- <b>Supports Multiple Platforms</b>: ASP.NET Core applications can run on Windows, Linux, and Mac. So you don't need to build different apps for different platforms using different frameworks.
- <b>Fast</b>: ASP.NET Core no longer depends on System.Web.dll for browser-server communication. ASP.NET Core allows us to include packages that we need for our application. This reduces the request pipeline and improves performance and scalability.
- <b>IoC Container</b>: It includes the built-in IoC container for automatic dependency injection which makes it maintainable and testable.
- <b>Integration with Modern UI Frameworks</b>: It allows you to use and manage modern UI frameworks such as AngularJS, ReactJS, Umber, Bootstrap, etc. using Bower (a package manager for the web).
- <b>Hosting</b>: ASP.NET Core web application can be hosted on multiple platforms with any web server such as IIS, Apache etc. It is not dependent only on IIS as a standard .NET Framework.
- <b>Code Sharing</b>: It allows you to build a class library that can be used with other .NET frameworks such as .NET Framework 4.x or Mono. Thus a single code base can be shared across frameworks.
- <b>Side-by-Side App Versioning</b>: ASP.NET Core runs on .NET Core, which supports the simultaneous running of multiple versions of applications.
- <b>Smaller Deployment Footprint</b>: ASP.NET Core application runs on .NET Core, which is smaller than the full .NET Framework. So, the application which uses only a part of .NET CoreFX will have a smaller deployment size. This reduces the deployment footprint.
