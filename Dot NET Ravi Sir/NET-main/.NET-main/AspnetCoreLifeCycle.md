## ASP.NET Core MVC Request Life Cycle
 
  Let us understand the Role and Responsibility of each stage in the ASP.NET Core MVC Request Life Cycle.

- <b>Middleware</b>: Middleware is the basic building block of the HTTP request pipeline. Request enters the request pipeline through middleware. In ASP.NET Core Web Application, these are a series of components combined to form a request pipeline to handle any incoming HTTP request.

- <b>Routing</b>: Routing is a middleware component that implements the MVC framework in ASP.NET Core Web Application. When a request is received, the ASP.NET Routing system matches the incoming URL to a route pattern defined in the application’s route configuration. This determines which controller and action method should handle the request with the help of convention and attribute routing.


- <b>Controller Initialization</b>: At this stage, the process of initialization and execution of controllers takes place. Once the routing system determines the appropriate controller and action method, an instance of the controller is created (.NET Framework uses the Reflection concept to create an instance of the controller class). The controller’s constructor and any dependencies are resolved using the configured dependency injection container.

- <b>Action Method Execution</b>: The action method specified in the route is invoked on the controller instance. The action method performs the necessary logic to generate the response. As part of the action method, the following things are going to happen.

- <b>Model Binding</b>: The model binding process takes place before the action method is executed. The framework maps the values from the request (e.g., query strings, form data, route parameters) to the action method’s parameters or model properties.
- <b>Action Filters</b>: Action filters can be applied to the action method or the controller to perform pre-and-post-processing logic. These filters can modify the request and perform authentication, authorization, logging, caching, etc.
- <b>Result Execution</b>: The action method returns an instance of an ActionResult or one of its derived classes, such as ViewResult, JsonResult, etc. The framework executes the appropriate result, which generates the response content.

- <b>View Rendering</b>: If the action result is a ViewResult, the view engine is invoked to render the corresponding view. The view combines the data provided by the controller with the HTML markup to produce the final HTML response.

- <b>Response</b>: The fully rendered HTML response is sent back to the client. This includes any HTTP headers, cookies, and the response body.

## ASP.NET Core MVC Request Life Cycle:
The request life cycle in ASP.NET Core MVC refers to the sequence of events that occur when an HTTP request is made to your application and how the framework handles and processes that request. Understanding the request life cycle is crucial for building and troubleshooting applications effectively. Here’s a high-level overview of the typical request life cycle in ASP.NET Core MVC:

1. <b>Incoming Request</b>: A client (browser, API client, etc.) sends an HTTP request to the ASP.NET Core application.
2. <b>HTTP Request Pipeline</b>: The request goes through the ASP.NET Core HTTP request pipeline, which is a series of middleware components that process the request. Middleware can perform tasks like authentication, authorization, logging, and more.
3. <b>Routing</b>: The routing middleware examines the request URL to determine which controller and action method should handle the request. Routes are configured in the Program.cs file.
4. <b>Controller Creation</b>: Once the appropriate route is determined, the MVC framework creates an instance of the corresponding controller.
5. <b>Action Method Selection</b>: The framework identifies the specific action method within the controller that should handle the request based on the route’s configuration.
6. <b>Model Binding</b>: Model binding is the process of mapping the data in the request (query parameters, form fields, route values, etc.) to parameters of the action method.
The framework automatically performs this mapping based on the method’s parameter names and data types.
7. <b>Action Execution</b>: The selected action method is executed. It can perform business logic, access databases, and prepare data for the view.
8. <b>View Rendering</b>: The action method returns a view (usually an HTML template) that should be rendered and returned to the client. The view may contain placeholders for dynamic data that will be replaced during rendering.
9. <b>View Engine</b>: The view engine (Razor, for example) processes the view, which replaces placeholders with actual data and generates HTML output.
10. <b>Response</b>: The HTML output from the view engine is included in an HTTP response. Additional response-related middleware might handle compression, caching, and other response manipulations.
11. <b>Outgoing Response Pipeline</b>: The response goes through the ASP.NET Core HTTP response pipeline, which includes any configured response middleware.
12. <b>Client Receives Response</b>: The processed response is sent back to the client (browser, API consumer, etc.) that made the initial request.
This is a simplified overview of the ASP.NET Core MVC request life cycle. Keep in mind that ASP.NET Core is highly customizable, and you can extend and modify the request life cycle by using middleware, filters, and other advanced features provided by the framework.
