Day 5
1. import day5.1 , into your existing workspace , to revise basic JSP syntax
1.1 Run it with and without cookies

2. Solve JSP assignment.
2.1 Basic JSP assignment with Request Dispatching(forward)
2.2 Student admission assignment (w/o DB)


Day 6
1. import day6.1 ,  into your existing workspace , to revise  (visit the links from index.jsp)
1.1 Error Handling in JSP
1.2 JSP standard actions : forward , include , param

2. import day6.2 ,  into your existing workspace , to revise : JSP -JavaBean --DAO --POJO --DB
layers

3. With lab faculty help (They will give detailed instructions)
MUST import test_hibernat_basic , in your workspace.
This will download hibernate dependencies , which will required on Monday.

4. Hands on :
Continue with day6.2.
In login.jsp , add a link for new voter registration.

4.1 Render voter registration form (voter_registration.jsp)
4.2 Submit the form to process_reg.jsp
Using Java Bean , perform the validation
Voter age > 21. 
In case of successful validation , User Bean should call User dao's method to insert a record.

4.3 Display registration status from JSP.


Day 7
1. import test_hibernate_basic in your workspace (if not done already) n download hibernate dependencies.

Hands on 
2. Refer to "day7-data\day7_help\IPL sql.txt"
Refer to teams table .
WE will create a standalone demo to create n insert teams records.

3. Complete Voter registration

4. If already done , start with voter flow.


Day 8

1. Copy day8_hibernate project in your workspace. Import it as existing Maven Project
Edit DB password , from hibernate.cfg.xml
1.1 Open com.app.tester
Go through the testers , to revise today's work.
You can go through Tester n trace DAO method invocations

2. Hands on

2.1 Continue with day7_lab (where you already have Team POJO n DAO)
Insert some IPL teams (using AddNewTeam tester)

Solve these objectives
1. Display  team id n abbreviation of all the teams
 no inputs required


2. Display team detailsby specified team id
i/p : team id
o/p : team details or null

3. Display all those teams who need , player's max age < specific age n min no of wickets taken > specified wickets. Sort the results as per desc order of max age
i/p : age , no of wickets

4. Update max age n batting avg requirement of a specific team by it's name (team name is unique)
i/p team name , new max age n batting avg


5. Delete team details
i/p : team id


Day 9
1. Integrate hibernate in a web app n start with IPL assignment


Day 10
0.Continue with day9_lab work.

1. We will first complete IPL assignment n then revise
1.1 What is already completed on Day 9?
Lifted team id n abbreviations of all teams from Team Dao layer --> sent it to Java Bean (TeamBean)--> sent it to JSP --> add_player_form.jsp
Displayed it using dyn drop down list in a form.
eg : 
${sessionScope.team_bean.teamDetails}


1.2 User will choose a team , fill up player details n submit the form.
URL ---> http://host:port/ctx_path/process_form.jsp

What will be the next step ?

In process_form.jsp :
1.3 Create instance of  Player bean , <jsp:useBean> n store under session scope. (OR still better create TeamBean n  PlayerBean instance in index.jsp itself)
1.4 Invoke matching setters
<jsp:setProperty>
1.5 Invoke PlayerBean's B.L method to validate n insert player details
eg : ${sessionScope.player.validateAndAddPlayer()}

2. In Player Bean : 
2.1 props : teamId : int ,fn,ln:string,dob:String,avg:double,wickets:int
+ PlayerDao , TeamDao
2.2 Bean Def ctor : create player dao instance , team dao instance

2.3 generate getters n setters

2.4 Add B.L method for validation n insertion
public String validateAndAddPlayer()
{
 1. Get team details from team id : simply call team dao's method n get team details
Team chosenTeam=teamDao.getTeamDetails(teamId);
2. validations 
LocalDate date=....
  int age=Period.between(date,LocalDate.now()).getYears();
  batting avg 
  wickets taken 
  In case of no validation errs : 
  simply call PlayerDao 's method to insert new player's details 
  method args : teamId , transient player object ref.
  rets : message
}


3. Team Dao 
Team getSelectedTeamDetails(Integer teamId)
Hint : session.get(...)

4. PlayerDao
String addPlayerDetails(Integer teamId,Player newPlayer)
Hint : session.get(...) --> Team --null --ret failure mesg
team.addPlayer(player) 
commit

2. Copy n import day10.1 in your workspace , as existing Maven project.

It has a demo of all E-Rs n also Entity-value Types.
It will be extremely confusing if you try to revise all of it on the same day.
So here's a suggestion.

Revise :  one to one mapping (uni dir shared PK approach)
n try to solve this.
1. Assign emp address
i/p : emp id n address details
Hint : AddressDao  
session.get/load --> Address entity /proxy
adr.setMyEmp(emp);
session.persist(adr);
commit

2. Display emp address (lab work)

i/p : emp id
AddressDao
Hint : session.get(Address.class,empId);


3. Display all emp details from specified city
i/p : city
AddressDao
jpql=select a.myEmp from Address a where a.city=:city


Day 11
1. Copy n import day11 projects in your workspace,
To revise 
1.1 Spring bean life cycle
1.2 Setter based D.I
1.3 Constructor based D.I
1.4 Factory method based D.I


Hands on

SC starts up
only : soap bean 

After 2 demands(made from the TestSpring)
my_atm:1  ---- http :1 
my_atm :2 ---- http : 2 

2. Hands on 
In our ATM scenario : 
Dependent Object : ATM Impl
Dependency : Transport layer.

Can 1 dependent object depend upon more dependencies ? YES
 Transport layer (already exists !)
Additional Dependencies :
ATM depends upon : cash component (long) . 
After any funds related operation , you have to inform bank n notify the customer.


1. cash : double/long
2. CustomerNotification Service (dependency i/f)
Add a method : public void alertCustomer(String mesg);
Implementations : EmailBased notification , Sms based notification
(Actual B.L is NOT expected . Just print the messages)

Wire cash component : using Constructor based DI (since it's MANDATORY : REQUIRED dependency of the ATM)

Wire : CustomerNotification Service using setter based DI

Test it out !
cash : 12345678
transport : http
email based notification


3. Auto wiring (implicit wiring using xml based configuration)

4. If time permits :
Add uni dir association , using shared PK approach , between : 
TeamOwner 1<---1 Team 
as discussed in the class.

Solve
4.1 Add new owner
(first name ,last name , email : unique)
4.2 Assign team to the owner.
4.3 Display specific owner details

Day 12

Full hands on in the labs 
As per the steps n flow discussed , complete these objectives

1. Copy n import spring_mvc_template
2. Deliver/render the index.jsp from SC (using spring MVC architecture)
(Write Home page controller , as shown)

3. Add a link in index.jsp
<h5>
		<a href="check/display">Test Me</a>
</h5>

When client clicks on the link ,
This request should be routed through : DispatcherServlet , HandlerMapping , Handler,ViewResolver n JSP

O/P 
Display server side date n time.
Display visit count
(It should start with 1 n then increment as per client requests)

Day 13
1. Copy n import day13.2 in your workspace .

Force update maven project.
Edit DB password from <resources>/application.properties file
Revise day13.2 completely
1.1 Spring Boot 
1.2 Spring Data JPA (intro)

OR 

Steps are in "Day13-data\day13_help\spring boot\spring-boot-steps.txt"
you can create spring boot project from Spring starter project (from scratch)
Choose dependencies. 
From pom.xml , change spring boot version to 2.7.18 n JDK version to 11
Force update. 

First approach will be faster. 


2.  Hands on
 Refer to : day13_data\day13_help\EMS assignment.png
In 1st half we will continue with the same case study.

In 2nd half : try IPL .

Refer to "Day13-data\day13_help\lab assignment.png" (IPL case study)

You will need extra help n hints . It's provided in "Day13-data\day13_help\readmes\Spring MVC Details.txt"

We will discuss it whenever required.

3. Refer day13_spring_mvc : revision of only Spring MVC

4. Refer day13_spring_mvc_hibernate : revision of only Spring MVC n hibernate (w/o Spring boot)

5. Refer day13_boot : Spring boot project created from scratch.
