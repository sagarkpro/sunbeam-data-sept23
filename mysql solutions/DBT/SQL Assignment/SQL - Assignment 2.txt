Q4: Why isn't possible to see the first five rows of a table?
Ans: At the time of saving the rows in server database hard disk, the rows get saved on the
     addresses available at that time or we can say that they get fragmentted all over the server database hard disk,
     and not in a sequential manner.Hence when we want to retrieve the first five rows back it will not be possible to retrieve
     them in a sequence,we will get the rows which are first available in the server database hard disk.
