SQL Assignment – 13

1) Create a union of two queries that shows the names, cities, and ratings of all customers. 
Those with rating of 200 or greater will also have the words “High Rating”, while the others will have the words “Low Rating”.
Ans:
SELECT CNAME,CITY, 'HIGHER RATING' RATING FROM CUSTOMERS
    -> WHERE rating>=200
    -> UNION
    -> SELECT CNAME,CITY,'LOWER RATING' RATING FROM CUSTOMERS
    -> WHERE rating <200;
+----------+----------+---------------+
| CNAME    | CITY     | RATING        |
+----------+----------+---------------+
| Giovanni | Rome     | HIGHER RATING |
| Liu      | San Jose | HIGHER RATING |
| Grass    | Berlin   | HIGHER RATING |
| Cisneros | San Jose | HIGHER RATING |
| Hoffman  | London   | LOWER RATING  |
| Clemens  | London   | LOWER RATING  |
| Pereira  | Rome     | LOWER RATING  |
+----------+----------+---------------+
7 rows in set (0.00 sec)

2) Write a command that produces the name and number of each salesperson and each customer with more than one current order.
 Put the results in alphabetical order.
Ans:
Select sname,snum,cname From salespeople
Join customers using(snum) WHERE snum IN
(Select snum From customers
 Group by snum
 Having count(snum)>1)
 Order by sname,cname;
+--------+------+---------+
| sname  | snum | cname   |
+--------+------+---------+
| Motika | 1004 | Grass   |
| Motika | 1004 | Liu     |
| Motika | 1004 | Pereira |
| Peel   | 1001 | Clemens |
| Peel   | 1001 | Hoffman |
+--------+------+---------+
5 rows in set (0.00 sec)

3) Form a union of three queries. Have the first select the snums of all salespeople in San Jose; 
the second, the cnums of all customers in San Jose; and the third the onums of all orders on October 3.
 Retain duplicates between the last two queries but eliminate any redundancies between either of them and the first.
(Note: in the sample tables as given, there would be no such redundancy. This is besides the point.)
Ans:
SELECT snum "Query"
FROM salespeople
WHERE city='san jose'
UNION
SELECT cnum
FROM customers
WHERE city='san jose'
UNION
Select onum from orders
where onum IN(Select onum from orders where odate like '03-OCT-%');

+-------+
| Query |
+-------+
|  1002 |
|  1100 |
|  2003 |
|  2008 |
+-------+
4 rows in set (0.00 sec)
